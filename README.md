# Missionaries and Cannibals Problem
 Missionaries and Cannibals is a common problem in the literature of AI, it is described as follows: assume three missionaries are accompanied by three cannibals, and all six of them have reached one side of a river and they are to pass to the other side. The problem is, there is only one boat that can fit only two persons, and since cannibals might eat missionaries, missionaries should not be outnumbered by cannibals at any point and at any side of the river. Also, remember that there must be someone to sail the boat, it does not move on its own. The solution of this problem is presented as a sequence of steps that describe who should the boat cary at each step until all missionaries and cannibals pass to the other side.
